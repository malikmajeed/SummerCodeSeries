🚀 **Project Update: Dynamic Counter with HTML, SASS, and JavaScript** 🚀

Excited to share my latest creation in the Summer Code Series! I've developed a dynamic counter that combines the power of HTML, SASS, and basic JavaScript. 🌐💻

🔹 **Power Button**: Turns the counter on to display counting, and resets to zero and hides the digits when turned off.
🔹 **Reset Button**: Instantly resets the counter to zero.
🔹 **Increment and Decrement Buttons**: Easily adjust the counter up or down.

This project showcases my skills in front-end development and enhances user interaction through intuitive design. Looking forward to implementing more exciting features and sharing them with you all!
